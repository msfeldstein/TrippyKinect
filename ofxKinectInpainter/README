Simple addon for filling holes in kinect depth maps using the cv::inpaint() function.

usage:

	setup:
		// the algorithm is quite demanding compuationally,
		// so you can do a downsampled version
		kinectInpainter.setup(width=640, height=480, downsampling=8);
	
	update:
		
		
		kinectInpainter.inpaint(depthImage);
		
	
	configuration:
	
		// 3-10 is a good value
		kinectInpainter.setInpaintingRadius(int radius);
	
		// 4-8 is realistic
		kinectInpainter.setDownsampling(int downsampleFactor);
